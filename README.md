## Models 
Many Models have been implemented to do the classification . 

**Base Models** : 

   1) Decision Tree 
   2) Random Forest 
   3) XGBoost
   4) Support Vector Machines
   5) Multilayer Perceptron 

**CNN Model** : 

   The Model trained using CNN's and Neural Networks over the mel spectrogram of the audio files . This Model has achieved best accurary in both train and test compared to the base models .
